description: Evaluating the home search experiences of potential home buyers/renters through usability testing

## Overview
The main objective of this *2-month-long* academic project was to assess the Zillow app and unconver usability issues that disrupt the users' home search experience. As a team of 4, we planned and conducted usability testing sessions with 6 participants via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**My Role** <br>
I was responsible for developing scripts with breakdowns of scenarios/tasks, moderating the sessions, and compiliing common issues that were found from the sessions. After completion of the course, I redeisnged some of the interface that had usability issues in my own time using Figma.

**Methods**<br>
Survey, Usability Testing, Prototyping (Figma)

<br>

## Objectives
Prior to conducting the usability study, our team conducted an informal heuristic evaluation of the app to understand user goals and identify pain points. Based on our understanding of user goals and usability issues we found via an evaluation, we wanted to tackle the following in this usability study:
* Assess Zillow’s <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">learnability</mark> and <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">ease of use</mark>
* Identify <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">common pain points</mark> and tasks that illuminate them
* Provide <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">actionable recommendations</mark> to improve the overall user experience

<br>

## Study Design
Each participant completed one session that was approximately 90-minutes long. The two groups of participants (Renters & Buyers) completed different sets of tasks based on their goals. Each session consisted of four different parts:
* Introduction
* Tasks
* Free Play
* Post-test Interview

Three different types of measures were used to assess the usability of the Zillow mobile app: performance measures, behavioral measures, and subjective measures.

<br>

## Results
From our usability tests, we identified three major issues that participants often faced: difficulty understanding app-specific <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">terminology</mark>, unintuitive <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">discoverability</mark> of app features, and difficulty <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">navigating</mark> through the app. <br>

![Updates & More]({{site.baseurl}}/images/updates_more.jpeg)

**Updates tab** - All renter and buyer participants struggled with locating their previously saved searches within the app as they did not expect to find them under the “Updates” tab.

**More tab** - All buyer participants had a difficult time finding tools (i.e. “Find an Agent”, "Affordability Calculator", “Payment Calculator”) that are located under the “More” tab. 

<br>

![Agent & Other Listing]({{site.baseurl}}/images/listings.jpeg) 

**"Agent" versus "Other" Listing** - When browsing through homes, buyer participants were confused as they didn't understand how agent listing and other listings are different. 

<br>

![Notes & More]({{site.baseurl}}/images/notes_more.jpeg)

**Save Notes** - Participants had a difficulty saving notes because it was hidden under the more icon. When 2 out of 6 participant successfully saved their notes on a listing, they struggled with locating where their notes were saved within the app; the only way to access it was through "Edit Notes".

<br>

![Invisible advanced feature]({{site.baseurl}}/images/advanced.jpeg)

**"Advanced" feature of Affordability/Payment Calculators** - 2 out of 3 buyer participants struggled with using Affordability and Payment Calculators because they did not expect to find additional criteria under "Advanced" which is invisible unless they scroll down. <br>

        <td><img src="/images/More_v2.png" width="350"></td>

</table>

* Renamed Updates and More tabs to <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">"Saved Searches"</mark> and <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">"Tools"</mark> to eliminate abiguity of the terms
* Put Recommended Homes below the Saved Searches
* Utilized more white space and consistent spacing between elements to reduce visual clutter

<br>

    <tr>
        <td><img src="/images/Listing_v2.png" width="720"></td>

* Created a <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">Filter button</mark> in the top right corner next to the search bar while removing existing filter options on the page.
* Added <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">Listing Type</mark> as a filter criterion with a brief explanation for each

        <td>Removed chat icon, as there is already a Message button under the description of the listing at the bottom. <br> <br> Instead, added a <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">note icon</mark> where users are able to add or edit their notes. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

        <td>Created tabs for Payment Breakdown and Amortization as the previous interface had amortization invisible.<br><br>Made the Advanced hyperlink more visible on the page using a bigger font and white space.<br><br>Changed the next step hyperlink to a button that is more noticeable.</td>
    </tr>

<br>

## Learnings
* **Teamwork is essential when conducting a usability testing.** <br>
After our team watched recordings of the usability testing sessions and had a debrief session together, a lot of important observations that I originally missed were revealed. As a team, we were able to validate our observations and interpretations together and produce a stronger report.

* **Review and run a pilot study before the actual usability testing session.** <br>
During our first couple study sessions, we noticed some tasks were redundant or not clearly explained to the participants. Running a pilot study would have been a great idea to avoid the issue we encountered in this project.
