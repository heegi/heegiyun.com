### Project Summary
This user research was conducted using three different methods in the following order: field studies, interviews, and surveys. During the field studies, it was found that many students value library space as a place free of distractions the most. Based on this pattern, the ultimate goal of the research was set to *how to improve the use of library space to provide students a better study environment without distractions*.

As a result, it was recommended that library should (1) have designated areas for individual and group work, (2) accommodate individual desks with wheels rather than tables, and finally (3) create designated multi-purpose area inside library for taking food breaks, playing video games, and having a social time with friends.

### Problem
The University of Washington campus hosts thousands of students every day. Libraries are considered as the first preferred space for university students to study, particularly for individual works ([Thaler](https://www.gensler.com/research-insight/gensler-research-institute/students-on-libraries)). This means that thousands of students use or have used library spaces on campus to study. While many universities have been trying to bring new changes to library spaces to align with students’ study habits, the most important library quality that students ranked was simply a **‘quiet space for students’** ([Thaler](https://www.gensler.com/research-insight/gensler-research-institute/students-on-libraries)).. This suggests that the core value of library space designs need to be reconsidered from the basics. It is necessary to investigate how we can improve the design of library space to provide students a better study environment.

### Field Studies
A total of three observation sessions were conducted, each consisting of approximately 30 minutes at different times of day with the aim of observing a wide range of participants and their behaviors. Data was recorded by taking notes on a laptop device, which was organized by the predetermined areas of focus. The notes were further analyzed through a color-coded affinity diagram to identify patterns in students’ study habits as well as their interactions with the library space.

The observations found that students who study in libraries face issues with the overall use of space, frequent food breaks, and inefficient use of big shared tables. In particular, these factors often distracted students from studying, disrupting their work quality and progress.

### Interviews
Expanding on the previous field studies, interviews were conducted to answer the design question of how can we improve the use of space in libraries of UW to provide students a better study environment without distractions. Three one-on-one interviews were conducted using the semi-structured approach with three UW undergraduate students who regularly study in UW libraries at least once a week. Each interview took place approximately for 30 minutes and all the interviews were recorded with the consent of the participants and later transcribed for data analysis.

Previous field studies identified frequent food breaks as one of the major issues that students faced while studying in library space. The interviews validated this finding, and further revealed that participants found other inappropriate uses of library space, such as talking and playing video games, as distracting. The participants also emphasized the importance of having a personal space when studying in library space and how disruption of their personal spaces distract them from studying. Finally, they shared issues with the quality and number of chairs in library space.

### Surveys
Lastly, I conducted surveys to students with or without regular experiences of studying in libraries in order to validate my findings across a larger population of students. Survey questions were carefully selected and worded, each with the rationale and plan for data analysis. Through the survey results, I found that (1) the primary reasons for library use is to study alone or with others and to use amenities, (2) quiet environment and flexibility for group work are valued the most in library spaces, and (3) people playing video games and people talking are most distracting and occur the most. The survey results are displayed in graphs below.

### Solutions
As a result, I came up with three recommendations for improving the use of space in libraries to provide students a better study environment free of distractions.

The primary reasons for library use is to study alone or with others and to use amenities. In addition, quiet environment and flexibility for group work are valued the most in library spaces. With that said, I recommend libraries to have designated areas for individual and group work within the building and accommodate individual desks with wheels rather than tables for flexibility of space.

As people playing video games or talking in the libraries are found to be most distracting and most occurring, creating a designated noise-free area for students would minimize distractions that happen tor those who study in libraries, while still providing space for those who wish to use library for talking, playing video games, and other social purposes. Below is an ideal layout of this noise-free multi-purpose area.

### Learnings
**1. It is crucial to ask users the right questions in the right way.**

Throughout this user research project, I learned that how questions are selected and worded can have a huge impact on users’ responses. In particular, interview questions had to be revised multiple times in order to avoid leading questions that may cause interviewees to answer in a biased way or confusing questions that may not be obvious to interviewees. I also learned that it is important to carefully choose the types of question to use in surveys based on the data I wish to gather.

**2. Have reasons behind how you prioritize the work.**

As a user researcher, prioritization of the work is important and it should have a valid justification. I learned that prioritization should be based on factors such as feasibility, desirability, and viability of the work as well as potential constraints that may be involved.
