### Project Summary
Zillow is an online real estate market company that allows users to search and explore homes that are available for purchase or rent.

The main objective of this project was to assess the Zillow mobile application to uncover usability issues that disrupt users’ experience when searching for homes and completing necessary tasks within the app. The usability tests were conducted with a total of six participants via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Project Type** <br>
Academic project with three other classmates

**Project Duration** <br>
2 months (March - May 2021)

**My Role** <br>
As a team of 4, we produced an end-to-end usability test protocol that contains all the materials used for preparing and executing the usability test as well as findings and recommendations from the study.

### Study Objectives
Prior to conducting the usability study, our team conducted an informal heuristic evaluation of the app to understand user goals and identify pain points. Based on our understanding of user goals and usability issues we found via an evaluation, we wanted to tackle the following in this usability study:
- Assess Zillow’s learnability and ease of use
- Investigate its performance, intuitiveness, and efficiency
- Identify common user pain points and tasks that illuminate them
- Provide recommendations or solutions to improve the overall user experience

### Participants
For this study, we ended up with a total of six participants due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on their primary goals, we divided them into two groups: renters and buyers.

### Study Design
Each participant completed one session that was approximately 90-minutes long. The two groups of participants completed different sets of tasks based on their goals. Each session consisted of four different parts:
- Introduction
- Tasks
- Free Play
- Post-test Interview

For our study, three different types of measures were used to assess the usability of the Zillow mobile app: performance measures, behavioral measures, and subjective measures.

### Results
From our usability tests, we identified three major issues that participants often faced: difficulty understanding app-specific terminology, unintuitive discoverability of app features, and difficulty navigating through the app.

![Updates & More]({{site.baseurl}}/images/updates_more.jpeg)

**"Updates" tab** - Both renter and buyer participants struggled with locating their previously saved searches within the app as they did not expect to find them under the “Updates” tab. Participants did not associate the term “Updates” with saved searches, and this hindered them from successfully completing the task. In addition, one of the participants expressed frustration over this issue during the post-test interview.

**"More" tab** - Buyer participants had difficulty finding features (e.g. “Find an Agent”, "Affordability Calculator", “Payment Calculator”) that are located under the “More” tab.

**"Agent Listings" versus "Other Listings"** - When browsing through homes, confusion was observed from buyer participants with the classification of listings into “Agent Listings” and “Other Listings” because some listings appeared in both categories.

![Notes & More]({{site.baseurl}}/images/notes_more.jpeg)

**"Save Notes" feature** - Participants had difficulty locating the “Save Notes” feature because the icon was ambiguous and was not consistently displayed on all the listings. Once participants successfully saved their notes on a listing, they struggled with locating where their notes were saved within the app, as the only way to access it is through "Edit Notes". One participant expressed a high level of frustration via verbal response during this task.

**"Advanced" feature of "Affordability/Payment Calculators"** - Two-thirds of buyer participants struggled with Affordability and Payment Calculators as they did not expect to find additional criteria by scrolling down and clicking on the “Advanced”.

### Recommendation
- The term “Updates” confused many users while trying to locate their saved searches. We recommend changing the term to “Saved” with the search magnifying glass icon. It is also recommended to give users feedback on where their notes are saved right after they save their notes.

- The term “More” is very broad, making it difficult for users to discover useful features and resources in the “More” tab. We recommend changing the term to “Resources” or “Tools” so that users are able to utilize features such as open house listings, real estate agent finder, mortgage plans, etc.

- The lack of clarification of the difference between “Agent Listings” and “Other Listings” caused confusion among users. We recommend either combining the two tabs or changing the term “Other Listings” to “For Sale By Owner” to eliminate the confusion. We also recommend adding an assistive feature or pop-up guide that highlights and explains features throughout the app so that it is easier for users to find and utilize useful features.

- To improve the navigation through the “Advanced” search within the Affordability and Payment calculators, we recommend the following:

- Add the "Advanced" tab as an additional step once users “confirm” their inputs for the first set of categories. Then, ask users if they would like to complete an “Advanced Search” with a short description of the difference between the two searches.

- Have a separate, easily noticeable button for the “Advanced” search feature at the top of the interface, rather than the bottom.

### Learnings
**1. Teamwork is essential when conducting a usability testing.**

After our team watched recordings of the usability testing sessions and had a debrief session together, a lot of important observations that I originally missed were revealed. As a team, we were able to validate our observations and interpretations together and produce a stronger report.

**2. Review the scripts and run a pilot study before the actual usability testing session.**

During our first couple study sessions, we noticed some tasks were redundant or not clearly explained to the participants. Running a pilot study would have been a great idea to avoid the issue we encountered in this project.
