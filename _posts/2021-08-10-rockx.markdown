## Project Summary
For an interaction design course, I was tasked to design a customer-facing (B2C) website for a theoretical hybrid music history museum called RockX. The main purpose of the website was to allow potential visitors to learn about Rock and Roll music and create a tour plan for their visit.

**Methods**<br>
Personas, Journey Mapping, Conceptual Model, Prototyping (Axure RP)

<br>

## Process
The entire project consisted of four different stages from understanding the potential users to developing a mid-fidelity prototype.

<br>

## Personas
Three personas were created that would interact with the B2C website.

<br>

## Journey Map
A user journey map was created for one of our personas, **Mark**, in order to understand how the user would experience the product over time.

## Conceptual Model
An object-action matrix, object-attributes table, and a prioritization matrix were developed to establish the grammar of the product prior to designing the product.

<br>

## User Flow
Before developing a prototype, a user flow diagram was created for users' main task with the product: planning the tour and saving it to follow up in the mobile application.

## Prototype
The prototype followed the *object-oriented* design with the major objects of Exhibits, Events, and Tours. You can access the interactive prototype <a href="https://gx1ci9.axshare.com" target="_blank" style="color: #6fb4ca;">here</a> or view some of the main screens below.

The **home page** features special exhibits and upcoming events, which can be directly added to the the user's tour plan via 'Add to Plan' buttons.

<br>

On the **Exhibits page** and **Events page**, the user can browse through all of the permanent and special exhibits as well as concerts and workshops that are currently offered at the museum and manually add them to their tour plan.

<br>

Through the **Tours page**, users can create a tour plan for their visit based on their interests and preferences. They can also obtain information about ticket prices and purchase their tickets.

After creating the plan or manually adding the exhibits/events to the plan, users are navigated to **My Tour page**, which allows them to view and edit their tour plan. It also prompts the users to transfer the tour plan to the mobile application using the provided QR code.

### Learning
* **Keep the grammar of the product in mind while designing the product.** <br>
While prototyping, I found it really helpful to look at the conceptual model and grammar as a guide when I felt overwhelmed or lost with my design. It reminded me of some necessary features/actions that I was missing in the design and make sure of the <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">consistency of language</mark> within the design.

* **Don't focus too much on the details.** <br>
During the design phase, I sometimes found myself spending hours just to decide on which colors or fonts to use for the UI. I learned that it is important to step back and focus more on how the prototype would guide the users through the <mark style="background-color: #FFE599">user flows</mark>.
