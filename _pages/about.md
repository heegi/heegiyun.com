Hello! I'm Heegi (she/her), a <span style="color: #545ed4;">**UX Designer**</span> with a knack for solving ambiguous problems to enhance user experiences through impactful research and data-driven design. Currently, I'm applying my skills as a **Human Factors Engineer** at **General Dynamics IT**, where I focus on creating user-friendly solutions through a wide range of design and research work.

As a life-long learner, I enjoy learning from and making meaningful relationships with others from diverse backgrounds and cultures. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in **Psychology** from the University of Washington, where I delved into human cognition and behavior. This passion led me to pursue a Master's degree in **Human Factors and Ergonomics** at San Jose State University, where I developed my skills in making technology more user-friendly and accessible.

When I'm not at my desk, I like to play video games. Some of my favorite video games are Animal Crossing New Horizons and League of Legends. I also like to spend time with my fur baby Benji who demands my attention 24/7.

I'm' always looking for opportunities to learn and grow! Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn below :)
