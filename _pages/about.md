Hello! I am Heegi (she/her), a <span style="color: #6fb4ca;">**UX researcher/designer**</span> who graduated with an **M.S. in Human Factors and Ergonomics** at San Jose State University in May 2022. Since then I have crafted this portfolio website while learning how to use *HTML* and *CSS*. I like to solve ambiguous problems to make a positive impact on users' experience, especially of those who are often underrepresented in a design space.

As a life-long learner, I enjoy learning from and making meaningful relationships with others, especially those from different backgrounds and cultures. I studied **Psychology** as an undergraduate student at University of Washington, and my curiosity about people's thoughts, behaviors, and emotions is something that drives me to be a well-rounded UX professional. 

When I'm not at my desk, I like to play video games! Some of my favorite video games are Animal Crossing, Legend of Zelda, and League of Legends. I also like to spend time with my 1-year-old puppy Benji who constantly looks for my attention.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow! Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn below :)
