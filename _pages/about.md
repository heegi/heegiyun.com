Hello! I am Heegi (pronounced as Hee-ji), a **UX Researcher** who recently graduated with an **M.S. in Human Factors and Ergonomics**. I would like to solve ambiguous problems to make a positive impact on users' experience, especially of those who are often underrepresented in a design space. 

I enjoy learning from and making meaningful relationships with others, especially those from different backgrounds and cultures. I studied **Psychology** as an undergraduate student and my curiosity about people's thoughts, behaviors, and emotions is something that drives me to be a well-rounded UX researcher.

When I'm not at my desk, I like to play video games! Some of my favorite video games are Animal Crossing, Ratchet & Clank, and League of Legends. I also like to spend time with my 9-months-old puppy Benji, who constantly looks for my attention.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow! Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn below :)
