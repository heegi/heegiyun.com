Hello! I am Heegi (pronounced as Hee-ji), a UX Researcher born and raised in South Korea. I am a second-year graduate student at San Jose State University pursuing an **MS in Human Factors and Ergonomics**. I received my Bachelor's degree in **Psychology** with minors in both Informatics and Diversity from University of Washington in June 2020.

I enjoy learning from and making meaningful relationships with others, especially those from different backgrounds and cultures. My curiosity about people's thoughts, behaviors, and emotions is something that drives me to be a well-rounded UX Researcher. I hope to make a positive impact on experiences of those who are often underrepresented, especially in a design space.

Outside school, I like to play video games, hang out with my 6-months-old puppy Benji, and eat Korean foods.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow! Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn below :)
