Hello! I am Heegi (she/her), a <span style="color: #545ed4;">**UX Designer**</span> currently designing & researching for Centers for Medicaid & Medicare (CMS) client as a **Human Factors Engineer** at **General Dynamics IT**. I solve ambiguous problems to make a positive impact on users' experience through empathetic research and human-centered design.

As a life-long learner, I enjoy learning from and making meaningful relationships with others, especially those from different backgrounds and cultures. I studied **Psychology** as an undergraduate student at University of Washington and further pursued a Master's degree in **Human Factors and Ergonomics** at San Jose State University, where I focused on understanding how my knowledge of human cognition and behavior can be used to make technology more accessible and easier to use for broader user base.

When I'm not at my desk, I like to play video games. Some of my favorite video games are Animal Crossing New Horizons and League of Legends. I also like to spend time with my fur baby Benji who seeks my attention 24/7.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow! Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn below :)
